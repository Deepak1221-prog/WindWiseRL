# WindWise RL â€” Wind Farm Layout Optimization (Prototype)

This repository contains a lightweight prototype for optimizing wind turbine placement using Reinforcement Learning (RL). It includes a Gym environment, a simple wake/power simulator, training and evaluation scripts, and utilities for loading data. The environment uses a grid-based layout and a simplified wake model (suitable for research/prototyping, not for final engineering design).

See README in /mnt/data/windwise_rl for step-by-step instructions.
